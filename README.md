## 9ssi7/mono: Monorepo Microservices Architecture Boilerplate

# Introduction

9ssi7/mono is a boilerplate for a microservices architecture using Docker. It provides a solid foundation for building and deploying microservices-based applications. The boilerplate includes a backend and frontend application, and it can be used to create other microservices as well.

# Benefits

* **Enforces modularity:** A monorepo enforces modularity by keeping all the code for a project in a single repository. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.
* **Simplifies dependency management:** A monorepo simplifies dependency management by allowing you to manage all the dependencies for a project in a single place. This reduces the risk of dependency conflicts and makes it easier to update dependencies.
* **Improves code sharing:** A monorepo improves code sharing by allowing you to easily share code between different microservices. This can help to reduce code duplication and improve the overall quality of the codebase.
* **Facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD):** A monorepo facilitates CI/CD by allowing you to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your application. This can help you to release new features and bug fixes more quickly and reliably.

# Getting Started

To get started with 9ssi7/mono, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/9ssi7/mono.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the application using the following commands:

```
cd mono
make install
make start
```

# Adding Git Submodules

9ssi7/mono uses Git submodules to manage dependencies. To add a Git submodule, you can use the following command:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git path/to/submodule
```

Once you have added a Git submodule, you can update it using the following command:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# Keeping Git Submodules Up-to-date

To keep your Git submodules up-to-date, you can use the following command:

```
git submodule update --remote
```

This will update the submodules to the latest version on the remote repository.

# Applications

9ssi7/mono is a great choice for applications that:

* Are composed of multiple microservices
* Need to be deployed frequently
* Need to be scalable
* Need to be reliable

# Testing

9ssi7/mono includes a set of tests that can be used to verify the functionality of the application. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```
make test
```

# Makefile

The Makefile provides a number of commands that can be used to build, test, and deploy the application.

## Commands

* **build:** Builds the application
* **test:** Runs the tests
* **start:** Starts the application
* **stop:** Stops the application
* **deploy:** Deploys the application

# .gitmodules File

The .gitmodules file contains information about the Git submodules that are used by the project. This file is used by Git to manage the submodules.

## Contents

The .gitmodules file contains the following information for each submodule:

* The URL of the remote repository
* The path to the submodule on the local filesystem
* The revision of the submodule

# Conclusion

9ssi7/mono is a powerful and flexible boilerplate for building microservices-based applications. It provides a number of features that can help you to build, test, and deploy your applications more easily.
